## Editing the common things

| What           | Where                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prices         | `index.html` → `<!-- PRICING -->` section                                                 |
| Services       | `index.html` → `<!-- SERVICES -->` section                                                |
| Phone number   | search for `94769647120` (WhatsApp links use the `94` country code, no leading `0`)       |
| Colours        | `css/styles.css` → the `:root` block at the top                                           |
| Gallery images | drop a JPEG in `assets/gallery/`, then copy a `.shot` button block in the gallery section |

Keep gallery images around 1000&nbsp;px wide and saved as JPEG so the page stays fast.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` publishes automatically via GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages →
Deploy from a branch → `main` / root). `.nojekyll` is present so files and folders
are served exactly as committed.
